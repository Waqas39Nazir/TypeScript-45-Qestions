/***
 * Q40: Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object
 *  describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name
 *  and an album title, and it should return a Object containing these
 *  two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries
 *  representing different albums. Print each return value to show that
 *  Objects are storing the album information correctly. Add an optional
 *  parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks
 *  on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks,
 *  add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call
 *  that includes the number of tracks on an album.
